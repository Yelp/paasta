"""Usage: ./synapse_srv_namespaces_fact.py

A simple script to enumerate all namespaces as a sorted comma separated
string to stdout, with each entry in the form of full_name:proxy_port.

If a proxy_port isn't defined for a namespace, that namespace is skipped.

Example output: mumble.canary:5019,mumble.main:111,zookeeper.hab:4921

This is nice to use as a facter fact for Synapse stuff!
