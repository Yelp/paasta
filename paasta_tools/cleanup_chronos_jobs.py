Usage: ./cleanup_chronos_jobs.py [options]

Clean up chronos jobs that aren't supposed to run on this cluster by deleting them.

Gets the current job list from chronos, and then a 'valid_job_list'
via chronos_tools.get_chronos_jobs_for_cluster

If a job is deployed by chronos but not in the expected list, it is deleted.
Any tasks associated with that job are also deleted.
