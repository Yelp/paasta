    Sort a list according to their fitness. This will return the list of instances
    in order of 'fitness': that is, that which is least desirable to kill is first in
    the list.

    Fitness is judged according to the following rules:
        - any instance considered to have a non 'ok' system or instance status is always
          considered to be least healthy
        - next, instances are ranked according to whether they have events planned. an event
          planned marks against your fitness.
        - next, instances are sorted according to the number of batch tasks running on them.
          we can't drain batch tasks, so make an effort to avoid disrupting them.
        - finally, instances are sorted according to the number of total tasks they have. those with
          the hightest total task are considered fittest, because it's painful to drain them.
