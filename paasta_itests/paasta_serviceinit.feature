Feature: paasta_serviceinit

  Scenario: marathon_serviceinit can run status
    Given a working paasta cluster
      And I have yelpsoa-configs for the marathon job "test-service.main"
      And we have a deployments.json for the service "test-service" with enabled instance "main"
     When we run the marathon app "test-service.main" with "1" instances
      And we wait for it to be deployed

     When we run the marathon app "test-service.main" with "1" instances
      And we wait for it to be deployed
      And we run paasta serviceinit "stop" on "test-service.main"
     Then there should be no matching appids for service "test-service" instance "main"
