====================================
Autoscaling PaaSTA Instances
====================================

PaaSTA allows programmatic control of the number of replicas (pods) a service has.
It uses Kubernetes' Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to watch a service's load and scale up or down.

How to use autoscaling
======================

Enabling autoscaling
--------------------

In order to use autoscaling, edit your ``kubernetes-*.yaml`` files in your soa
configs and add a ``min_instances`` and a ``max_instances`` attribute and
(optionally) remove the ``instances`` attribute from each instance you want to autoscale.
When using autoscaling, the ``min_instances`` and ``max_instances`` attributes
become the minimum and maximum (inclusive) number of replicas tasks Kubernetes will
create for your job.

If load history for your service is missing in Prometheus for some/all replicas, the Prometheus query will assume that each missing replica is at 100% load.
The reasoning behind this is that during a situation where there is missing data, scaling a service up is generally the safest course of action.
This behavior may mean that your service is scaled up unnecessarily when you first enable autoscaling.
Don't worry - the autoscaler will soon learn what the actual load on your service is, and will scale back down to the appropriate level.

If you use autoscaling it is highly recommended that you make sure your service has a readiness probe.
If your service is registered in Smartstack, each pod automatically gets a readiness probe that checks whether that pod is available in the service mesh.
Non-smartstack services may want to configure a ``healthcheck_mode``, and either ``healthcheck_cmd`` or  ``healthcheck_uri`` to ensure they have a readiness probe.
The HPA will ignore the load on your pods between when they first start up and when they are ready.
This ensures that the HPA doesn't incorrectly scale up due to this warm-up CPU usage.

Autoscaling parameters are stored in an ``autoscaling`` attribute of your instances as a dictionary.
Within the ``autoscaling`` attribute, setting a ``metrics_provider`` will allow you to specify a method that determines the utilization of your service.
If a metrics provider isn't provided, the ``cpu`` metrics provider will be used.
Specifying a ``setpoint`` allows you to specify a target utilization for your service.
The default ``setpoint`` is 0.8 (80%).

Let's look at sample kubernetes config file:

.. sourcecode:: yaml

   ---
   main:
     cpus: 1
     mem: 300
     min_instances: 30
     max_instances: 50
     autoscaling:
       metrics_provider: cpu
       setpoint: 0.5

This makes the instance ``main`` autoscale using the ``cpu`` metrics provider.
PaaSTA will aim to keep this service's CPU utilization at 50%.

Autoscaling components
----------------------

Metrics providers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The currently available metrics providers are:

:cpu:
  The default autoscaling method if none is provided.
  Measures the CPU usage of your service's container.

:uwsgi:
  With the ``uwsgi`` metrics provider, Paasta will configure your pods to run an additional container with the `uwsgi_exporter <https://github.com/timonwong/uwsgi_exporter>`_ image.
  This sidecar will listen on port 9117, and will request metrics from your uWSGI master via its `stats server <http://uwsgi-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/StatsServer.html>`_.
  The uwsgi_exporter container needs to know what port your uWSGI master's stats server is on - you can configure this with the ``uwsgi_stats_port`` key in the ``autoscaling`` dictionary.
  ``uwsgi_exporter`` will translate the uWSGI stats into Prometheus format, which Prometheus will scrape.

  .. note::

    If you have configured your service to use a non-default stats port (8889), you need to explicity set ``uwsgi_stats_port`` in your autoscaling config with the same value to ensure that metrics are being exported.

  Extra parameters:

  :uwsgi_stats_port:
    the port that your uWSGI master process will respond to with stats.
    Defaults to 8889.

:gunicorn:
  With the ``gunicorn`` metrics provider, Paasta will configure your pods to run an additional container with the `statsd_exporter <https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter>`_ image.
  This sidecar will listen on port 9117 and receive stats from the gunicorn service. The ``statsd_exporter`` will translate the stats into Prometheus format, which Prometheus will scrape.


Decision policies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The currently available decicion policies are:

:proportional:
  (This is the default policy.)
  Uses a simple proportional model to decide the correct number of instances
  to scale to, i.e. if load is 110% of the setpoint, scales up by 10%.

  Extra parameters:

  :offset:
    Float between 0.0 and 1.0, representing expected baseline load for each container.
    Defaults to 0.0.
  :good_enough_window:
    **Not currently supported**
    An array of two utilization values [low, high].
    If utilization per container at the forecasted total load is within the window, instances will not scale.
    Optional parameter (defaults to None).

    This is not currently supported under Kubernetes (see PAASTA-17262), but Kubernetes has a `global 10% tolerance by default. <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details>`_
    This is equivalent to a good_enough_window of ``[0.9*setpoint, 1.1*setpoint]``
  :moving_average_window_seconds:
    The number of seconds to load data points over in order to calculate the average.
    Defaults to 1800s (30m).
    Currently, this is only supported for ``metrics_provider: uwsgi``.

:bespoke:
  Allows a service author to implement their own autoscaling.
  This policy results in no HPA being configured.
  An external process should periodically decide how many replicas this service needs to run, and use the Paasta API to tell Paasta to scale.
  See the :ref:`How to create a custom (bespoke) autoscaling method` section for details.

How to create a custom (bespoke) autoscaling method
---------------------------------------------------

The current number of instance for a service can be accessed through the PaaSTA
api from the endpoint ``/v1/services/SERVICE_NAME/INSTANCE_NAME/autoscaler``.
Sending an HTTP GET request will return an integer describing how many
instances PaaSTA thinks your sevice should have. This endpoint also accepts an
HTTP POST request with a JSON payload with the format ``{'desired_instances':
NUMBER_OF_DESIRED_INSTANCES}``. This endpoint can be used to control the number
of instances PaaSTA thinks your service should have.

Finally, remember to set the ``decision_policy`` of the ``autoscaling``
parameter for each service instance to ``"bespoke"`` or else PaaSTA will
attempt to autoscale your service with the default autoscaling method.
