Getting Started
===============

**Warning**: PaaSTA is an opinionated way to integrate a collection of open
source components in a holistic way to build a PaaS. It is not optimized to be
simple to deploy for operators. It is optimized to not reinvent the wheel and
utilizes existing solutions to problems where possible.

PaaSTA has many dependencies. This document provides documentation on
installing some of these dependencies, but some of them are left as an
exercise to the reader.

PaaSTA is used *in production* at Yelp, and has never been designed to be
easy to deploy or installable from a single command (``curl paasta.sh | sudo bash``).
We don't install things that way at Yelp, and we don't expect others
to install things like that either. At Yelp we happen to use Puppet to deploy
PaaSTA and the related components. Currently all of the Puppet code is not
open source, but we hope to eventually have a fully working example deployment.

paasta_tools
------------

The ``paasta_tools`` package contains the PaaSTA CLI and other extra integration
code that interacts with the other components. Binary packages of ``paasta_tools``
are currently not available, so one must build them and install them manually::

  git clone git@github.com:Yelp/paasta.git
  # Assuming you are on Ubuntu Trusty
  make itest_trusty
  sudo dpkg -i dist/paasta_tools*.deb

This package must be installed anywhere the PaaSTA CLI and on the Mesos/Marathon
masters. If you are using SmartStack for service discovery, then the package must
be installed on the Mesos Slaves as well so they can query the local API.

Once installed, ``paasta_tools`` reads global configuration from ``/etc/paasta/``.
This configuration is in key/value form encoded as JSON. All files in ``/etc/paasta``
are merged together to make it easy to deploy files with configuration management.

For example, one essential piece of configuration that must be deployed to servers
that are a member of a particular cluster is the ``cluster`` setting::

  # /etc/paasta/cluster.json
  {
    "cluster": "test-cluster"
  }

It is not necessary to define this config option for servers that only require the
PaaSTA CLI tools (as they may not technically be part of any particular PaaSTA cluster).

soa-configs
-----------

soa-configs are the shared configuration storage that PaaSTA uses to hold the
description and configuration of what services exist and how they should be
deployed and monitored.

This directory needs to be deployed globally in the same location to every
server that runs any PaaSTA component. See the
`dedicated documentation <../soa_configs.html>`_ on how to build your own ``soa-configs``.

``soa-configs`` also transport the ``deployments.json`` files for each service.
This file contains a mapping for which shas should be deployed where. These files
are generated by the ``generate_all_deployments`` command. This method allows PaaSTA
to inspect the deployments for each service once, and deploy that information in
soa-configs, as opposed to having each cluster inspecting git directly.

Docker and a Docker Registry
----------------------------

PaaSTA uses `Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`_ to build and distribute code for each service. PaaSTA
assumes that a single registry is available and that the associated components
(Docker commands, unix users, mesos slaves, etc) have the correct credentials
to use it.

The docker registry needs to be defined in a config file in ``/etc/paasta/``.
PaaSTA merges all json files in ``/etc/paasta/`` together, so the actual
filename is irrelevant, but here would be an example
``/etc/paasta/docker.json``::

  {
    "docker_registry": "private-docker-registry.example.com:443"
  }

There are many registries available to use, or you can
`host your own <https://docs.docker.com/registry/>`_.

Mesos
-----

PaaSTA uses Mesos to do the heavy lifting of running the actual services on
pools of machines.  See the `official documentation <http://mesos.apache.org/gettingstarted/>`_
on how to get started with Mesos.

Marathon
--------

PaaSTA uses `Marathon <https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/>`_ for supervising long-running
services running in Mesos. See the `official documentation <https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon/docs/>`_
for how to get started with Marathon.

Then, see the `PaaSTA documentation <yelpsoa_configs.html#marathon-clustername-yaml>`_
for how to define Marathon jobs.

Once Marathon jobs are defined in soa-configs, there are a few tools provided by PaaSTA
that interact with the Marathon API:

* ``deploy_marathon_services``: Does the initial sync between soa-configs and
  the Marathon API. This tools is idempotent and should be periodically. This is also
  the tools that handles "bouncing" new version of code.
* ``cleanup_marathon_jobs``: Cleans up lost or abandoned services. This tool
  looks for Marathon jobs that are *not* defined in soa-configs and removes them.
* ``check_marathon_services_replication``: Iterates over all Marathon services
  and inspects their health. This tool integrates with the monitoring infrastructure
  and will alert the team responsible for the service if it becomes unhealthy to
  the point where manual intervention is required.

Chronos
-------

`Chronos <http://mesos.github.io/chronos/>`_ is a Marathon framework for
running scheduled tasks. See the `official documentation <http://mesos.github.io/chronos/docs/getting-started.html>`_
for how to get started with Chronos, and then see the `PaaSTA documentation <yelpsoa_configs.html#marathon-clustername-yaml>`_
for how to define Chronos jobs.

PaaSTA has tools for synchronizing jobs with the Chronos API:

* ``deploy_chronos_jobs``: This tool does the bouncing and initial setup of Chronos
  jobs that are defined in soa-configs.
* ``cleanup_chronos_jobs``: Cleans up lost or abandoned Chronos jobs.
* ``check_chronos_jobs``: Iterates over the current status of the Chronos jobs associated
  with a service and alerts the team responsible when they start to fail.

SmartStack
----------

`SmartStack <http://nerds.airbnb.com/smartstack-service-discovery-cloud/>`_ is
a dynamic service discovery system that allows clients to find and route to
healthy mesos tasks for a particular service.

The glue that actually configures SmartStack is `currently not open source <https://github.com/Yelp/paasta/issues/13>`_.

Other service-discovery mechanisms can be used with PaaSTA, but SmartStack
is currently the only supported method.

While SmartStack is open source, the tools we use to configure Nerve and
Synapse from soa-configs are currently not open source. Stay tuned as we will
be opening them up soon.

Sensu
-----

`Sensu <https://sensuapp.org/>`_ is a flexible and scalable monitoring system
that allows clients to send alerts for arbitrary events. PaaSTA uses Sensu to
allow individual teams to get alerts for their services.

The `official documentation <https://sensuapp.org/docs/latest/overview>` has
instructions on how to set it up.

Out of the box Sensu doesn't understand team-centric routing, and must be combined
with handlers that are "team aware" it it is installed in a multi-tenant environment.
We to do that, we have written some `custom Sensu handlers <https://github.com/Yelp/sensu_handlers>`_
to do that.

Sensu is an optional but highly recommended component.

Jenkins / Build Orchestration
-----------------------------

Jenkins is the suggested method for orchestrating build pipelines for services,
but it is not a hard requirement. The actual method that Yelp uses to integrate
Jenkins with PaaSTA is not open source.

In practice, each organization will have to decide how they want to actually
run the ``paasta`` cli tool to kick off the building and deploying of images.
This may be something as simple as a bash script::

  #!/bin/bash
  service=my_service
  sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
  paasta itest --service $service --commit $sha
  paasta push-to-registry --service $service --commit $sha
  paasta mark-for-deployment --git-url $(git config --get remote.origin.url) --commit $sha --deploy_group prod.main --service $service

PaaSTA can integrate with any existing orchestration tool that can execute
commands like this.

Scribe
------

PaaSTA currently uses `Scribe <https://github.com/facebookarchive/scribe>`_ to
centrally log events about what is happening in the infrastructure and to power
``paasta logs``. Currently this is the most "Yelpy" aspect of PaaSTA, so much
so that have had to remove it from the normal ``requirements.txt``. We are
investigating ways to make the logging components of PaaSTA more reusable for
everyone. Till then it is not expected that PaaSTA logging will work in a
non-Yelp environment.
